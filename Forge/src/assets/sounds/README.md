# Sound Assets

This directory contains sound effects for the Forge app. The following sound files need to be added:

1. `timer-start.mp3` - A gentle chime sound played when starting a timer
2. `timer-end.mp3` - A more prominent sound played when a timer completes
3. `task-complete.mp3` - A success sound played when completing tasks
4. `level-up.mp3` - An achievement sound played when gaining experience levels

## Sound Requirements

- All sounds should be in MP3 format
- Keep file sizes small (under 100KB each)
- Sounds should be subtle and not jarring
- Volume levels should be consistent across all sounds

## Placeholder Files

Currently, these files are placeholders. Before release, we need to:

1. Source appropriate sound effects
2. Test volume levels and consistency
3. Ensure sounds work well in both Focus and Rest modes
4. Consider different sounds for Focus vs Rest timer completion

## Sound Attribution

When adding actual sound files, include attribution here if using licensed sounds.

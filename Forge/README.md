# Monk Mode: Forge

A mobile app designed for individuals in "Monk Mode"â€”a protocol of extreme focus and discipline, committing 100% to their goals. Forge bridges the gap between **agency** (the power to act decisively) and **intentionality** (clarity of purpose) with a brutal, honest approach.

## Features

### 1. Intention-Setting

- Daily "North Star" intention setting (one win for the day)
- Weekly intentions (3 goals, 1 North Star)
- Cycling suggestions for quick inspiration

### 2. Task Management

- Priority-based to-do list organized by Today, Next, and Later
- North Star task highlighting
- Subtasks with progress tracking
- Task details with notes and time estimates

### 3. Focus Timer

- Task-linked timer with Focus and Rest modes
- Stunning visuals: fire animation (Focus) and water animation (Rest)
- Customizable timer presets (25/5, 90/30, 50/10)
- App blocking to eliminate distractions

### 4. Profile & Analytics

- Weekly stats (Focus hours, Rest hours, Distraction breaches)
- Task completion tracking
- Experience system with level progression
- Settings for customization
